Florence with Locals is a comprehensive tour guide management system designed specifically for tour operators in Florence, Italy. It features a **modern, responsive UI** with complete CRUD operations, role-based access control, and integration with Bokun booking platform.

## 🌟 **LIVE PRODUCTION SITE** 🌟

### 🚀 **[https://withlocals.deetech.cc](https://withlocals.deetech.cc)** - FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅

**Latest Update (2025-10-26)**: ✅ **THREE CRITICAL PRODUCTION FIXES COMPLETE** - (1) **Payments Page Fix**: Resolved production error by creating missing database views (`guide_payment_summary`, `monthly_payment_summary`) and correcting table name references from `payment_transactions` to `payments` in API files - payments page now fully operational. (2) **Tour Date Bug**: Tours were displaying under booking creation date instead of actual tour date - removed incorrect `creationDate` fallback in BokunAPI.php, updated 65 tours to correct dates. (3) **Bokun Sync Optimization**: Sync was only fetching TODAY forward - changed to fetch past 7 days + next 30 days (37-day rolling window), imported 6 missing October 24 bookings. Production now fully synchronized with Bokun API data and all payment features working.

**Previous Update (2025-10-25)**: ✅ **DATABASE SCHEMA SYNCHRONIZED** - Fixed production database schema mismatches that were causing application failures. Added missing `bokun_experience_id` and `last_sync` columns, corrected `payment_status` enum to include 'overpaid', and fixed sessions table `token` column (login now works). Priority Tickets date filter changed to show all bookings by default. Production database now has 40 columns matching local development exactly.

**Previous Update (2025-10-24)**: ✅ **BOOKING DETAILS MODAL & ENHANCED UX COMPLETE** - Deployed comprehensive Booking Details Modal with 6 detailed sections (tour info, main contact, participants breakdown, booking details, special requests, internal notes). Priority Tickets page enhanced with participant breakdown (adults/children, INFANT excluded), morning bookings first sorting. Tours page integrated with same modal functionality. GitHub repository established at https://github.com/DhaNu1204/guide-florence-with-locals.git.

**Previous Update (2025-10-15)**: ✅ **INTELLIGENT DATA EXTRACTION COMPLETE** - Implemented automatic multi-channel language detection from Bokun API (Viator, GetYourGuide), smart payment status tracking distinguishing customer vs guide payments, and intelligent ticket product filtering. All 132+ tours now have accurate language data extracted automatically with no defaults to prevent incorrect guide assignments.

**Previous Update (2025-09-29)**: ✅ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE** - The entire Florence with Locals Tour Guide Management System is now live and fully operational on production servers. All critical deployment issues have been resolved, including environment configuration, database migration, Bokun integration (47 bookings synchronized), and payment system functionality. Ready for active use.

  - **Root Cause**: Production database missing 2 columns and 1 incorrect enum value
  - **Missing Columns Added**:
    - `bokun_experience_id VARCHAR(255)` - Track Bokun experience IDs for API sync
    - `last_sync TIMESTAMP` - Track last synchronization time for Bokun integration

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Development Server Issues
- **Port Conflicts**: App may start on ports 5173, 5174, or 5175 - check console output
- **API Connection**: Ensure PHP server running on localhost:8080
- **Database Connection**: Verify MySQL service and credentials in config.php

#### Component Errors  
- **Icon Import Errors**: Use correct React Icons names (e.g., `FiHome` not `FiBuilding`)
- **JSX Parsing Errors**: Ensure proper opening/closing tag matching for components
- **Build Failures**: Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies if needed

#### Data Synchronization
- **Cache Issues**: Data cached for 1 minute - wait or force refresh for immediate updates
- **Cross-device Sync**: Server data is source of truth, localStorage used as fallback only
- **Database Inconsistencies**: Use `/api/database_check.php` to verify table structure

**Project Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL WITH DATABASE SCHEMA SYNCHRONIZED** - Complete modern tour management system live at https://withlocals.deetech.cc with all features working perfectly. **Critical deployment (Oct 25, 2025)**: Fixed production database schema mismatches - added missing `bokun_experience_id` and `last_sync` columns, corrected `payment_status` enum to include 'overpaid', fixed sessions table `token` column (login working), and changed Priority Tickets date filter to show all bookings by default. Production database now has 40 columns matching local development exactly. All CRUD operations, authentication, and Bokun sync fully operational. **Previous deployment (Oct 24, 2025)**: Comprehensive Booking Details Modal with 6 detailed sections, Priority Tickets enhancements, Tours page modal integration, GitHub repository: https://github.com/DhaNu1204/guide-florence-with-locals.git. **132+ bookings with automatic multi-channel language detection** (Viator, GetYourGuide), smart payment tracking, and complete database parity.

**Last Updated**: October 25, 2025 - **CRITICAL DATABASE FIXES**: Synchronized production database with local development by adding missing `bokun_experience_id` and `last_sync` columns, correcting `payment_status` enum to include 'overpaid', and fixing sessions table `token` column. Fixed Priority Tickets date filter to show all bookings by default (was empty due to today's date filter). All application failures resolved - CRUD operations, authentication, Bokun sync, and data display now fully functional on production. Database now has complete parity with local environment (40 columns).
