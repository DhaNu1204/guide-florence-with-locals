- **API Connection**: Ensure PHP server running on localhost:8080
- **Database Connection**: Verify MySQL service and credentials in config.php

#### Component Errors  
- **Icon Import Errors**: Use correct React Icons names (e.g., `FiHome` not `FiBuilding`)
- **JSX Parsing Errors**: Ensure proper opening/closing tag matching for components
- **Build Failures**: Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies if needed

#### Data Synchronization
- **Cache Issues**: Data cached for 1 minute - wait or force refresh for immediate updates
- **Cross-device Sync**: Server data is source of truth, localStorage used as fallback only
- **Database Inconsistencies**: Use `/api/database_check.php` to verify table structure
