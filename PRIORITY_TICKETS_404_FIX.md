# Priority Tickets 404 Fix - Deployment Guide

## Issue Description

**Problem**: Direct URL access to https://withlocals.deetech.cc/priority-tickets returns 404 error
**Cause**: Missing .htaccess file for React Router SPA support in production
**Solution**: Add .htaccess file to enable Apache URL rewriting for client-side routing

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Root Cause
- React Router handles routing client-side (in the browser)
- When refreshing or directly accessing `/priority-tickets`, Apache server looks for a physical file
- Without .htaccess rewrite rules, Apache returns 404 for non-existent files

### 2. Solution Implemented
- Created `public/.htaccess` file with Apache rewrite rules
- Vite automatically copies this file to `dist/` during build
- Apache now redirects all non-file requests to `index.html`, letting React Router handle routing

## Files Changed

### NEW: `public/.htaccess`
```apache
# Enable rewrite engine
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /

  # Don't rewrite files or directories
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

  # Don't rewrite API requests
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/api/

  # Redirect all other requests to index.html
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

**Additional features:**
- Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
- Directory listing prevention
- Static file caching
- Gzip compression

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Full Rebuild and Deploy (Recommended)

1. **Build production bundle:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Verify .htaccess is in dist:**
   ```bash
   ls -la dist/.htaccess
   ```

3. **Deploy to production via SSH:**
   ```bash
   # Connect to server
   ssh -p 65002 u803853690@82.25.82.111

   # Navigate to production directory
   cd /home/u803853690/domains/deetech.cc/public_html/withlocals

   # Upload dist folder contents (from local machine)
   # Use SCP or FTP to upload dist/* to production
   ```

4. **Verify deployment:**
   ```bash
   # On server, check .htaccess exists
   ls -la /home/u803853690/domains/deetech.cc/public_html/withlocals/.htaccess
   ```

### Option 2: Quick Fix - Upload .htaccess Only

1. **Copy .htaccess from dist:**
   ```bash
   # After running npm run build
   # The file is at: dist/.htaccess
   ```

2. **Upload to production:**
   ```bash
   # Upload dist/.htaccess to production root
   # Production path: /home/u803853690/domains/deetech.cc/public_html/withlocals/.htaccess
   ```

## Testing

### Test Direct URL Access

1. Open browser in incognito mode
2. Navigate directly to: https://withlocals.deetech.cc/priority-tickets
3. ✅ Should load Priority Tickets page (not 404)

### Test All Routes

Test these URLs directly (copy-paste in browser):
- ✅ https://withlocals.deetech.cc/
- ✅ https://withlocals.deetech.cc/tours
- ✅ https://withlocals.deetech.cc/guides
- ✅ https://withlocals.deetech.cc/payments
- ✅ https://withlocals.deetech.cc/tickets
- ✅ https://withlocals.deetech.cc/priority-tickets
- ✅ https://withlocals.deetech.cc/bokun-integration

### Test Refresh

1. Navigate through menu to Priority Tickets
2. Press F5 to refresh
3. ✅ Should stay on Priority Tickets page (not 404)

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Build completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] `.htaccess` file exists in `dist/` folder
- [ ] `.htaccess` file uploaded to production root
- [ ] Direct URL access works for all routes
- [ ] Refresh works on all pages
- [ ] API endpoints still work (/api/tours.php, etc.)
- [ ] Login functionality works
- [ ] No broken images or assets

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, remove the .htaccess file:

```bash
# On production server
cd /home/u803853690/domains/deetech.cc/public_html/withlocals
mv .htaccess .htaccess.backup
```

## Technical Notes

### Why This Fix Works

1. **Apache mod_rewrite**: Intercepts all HTTP requests
2. **Conditional checks**: Only rewrites if file/directory doesn't exist
3. **API exclusion**: Doesn't interfere with backend API calls
4. **Fallback to index.html**: Lets React Router handle the route client-side

### Production Environment

- **Server**: Hostinger shared hosting
- **Web Server**: Apache with mod_rewrite enabled
- **Production Path**: /home/u803853690/domains/deetech.cc/public_html/withlocals
- **Domain**: https://withlocals.deetech.cc

### Impact

- ✅ Fixes 404 errors on direct URL access
- ✅ Enables browser refresh on any route
- ✅ Allows bookmarking/sharing specific pages
- ✅ Improves SEO (search engines can access all pages)
- ✅ No impact on existing functionality
- ✅ No database changes required
