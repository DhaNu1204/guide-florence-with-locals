## Recent Major Updates

### ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIXES & UI ENHANCEMENTS (2025-10-19)
- **Dashboard Chronological Sorting**: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed Unassigned Tours and Upcoming Tours sorting
  - **Issue**: Tours were only sorted by date, not time, causing incorrect display order
  - **Fix Location**: `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` lines 86-91 (Unassigned Tours), lines 108-113 (Upcoming Tours)
  - **Solution**: Implemented combined date+time sorting: `new Date(a.date + ' ' + a.time)` for accurate chronological order
  - **Result**: Tours now display in true chronological sequence (e.g., 19/10 10:00, 19/10 17:00, 19/10 17:30, 21/10 09:30)

- **Tours Page CRUD Operations Fix**: ✅ COMPLETED - Resolved guide assignment and notes persistence
  - **Issue**: Guide assignments and notes were not saving to database despite correct frontend implementation
  - **Root Cause**: Backend `tours.php` PUT handler (lines 307-326) missing field handling for `guide_id` and `notes`
  - **Fix Applied**:
    - Added backward-compatible handling for both `guideId` (camelCase) and `guide_id` (snake_case)
    - Added complete `notes` field handling in PUT request
    - Implemented proper NULL value handling for guide assignments
  - **Testing**: Verified with curl - both fields now persist correctly to database
  - **Files Modified**: `public_html/api/tours.php` lines 307-326

- **Priority Tickets Page Redesign**: ✅ COMPLETED - Enhanced museum ticket booking management
  - **Removed**: Confirmation column (bokun_confirmation_code/external_id display)
  - **Added**: Notes column with full inline CRUD functionality
  - **Features Implemented**:
    - Click-to-edit notes interface with textarea expansion
    - Save (green checkmark) and Cancel (red X) buttons
    - Real-time database persistence using `updateTour()` API
    - Visual feedback: "Click to add notes..." placeholder for empty notes
    - Hover effects for improved user experience
  - **Column Width Balancing**: Optimized table layout for better readability
    - Date: 100px, Time: 70px, Museum: 130px, Customer: 120px
    - Contact: 180px (wider for email addresses)
    - Participants: 90px, Booking Channel: 120px
    - Notes: Flexible width (expands to fill remaining space)
  - **Database Integration**: Uses existing `notes` column in `tours` table (no schema changes required)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/pages/PriorityTickets.jsx` - Complete component update
    - Added state management: `editingNotes`, `savingChanges`
    - Added CRUD functions: `saveNotes()`, `handleNotesChange()`, `cancelNotesEdit()`
  - **Icons Added**: FiSave, FiX from react-icons/fi

- **Authentication Session Fix**: ✅ COMPLETED - Resolved login failure
  - **Issue**: 500 Internal Server Error during login - sessions table INSERT missing `session_id` field
  - **Fix Location**: `public_html/api/auth.php` line 56
  - **Solution**: Added `session_id` field to both INSERT statement and parameter binding
  - **Result**: Login now works successfully, permanent fix applied

- **Multiple Servers**: **NEVER run multiple development servers simultaneously**
  - **SOLUTION**: Kill all background Vite servers before starting new one
- **Icon Errors**: Ensure correct React Icons import names (FiHome, not FiBuilding)
- **Build Errors**: Clear cache with `npm run dev` restart

#### Backend Issues
- **Database Connection**: Verify MySQL service and credentials in config.php
- **PHP Extensions**: Ensure curl, openssl, mysqli are enabled
- **API Responses**: Check CORS headers and request methods

#### Integration Issues
- **Bokun API**: Connection works, awaiting booking channel permissions
