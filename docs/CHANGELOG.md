# Changelog - Recent Major Updates

## ‚úÖ BOKUN SYNC DATE RANGE FIX (2025-10-26)

### Bokun Auto-Sync Optimization
‚úÖ COMPLETED - Fixed sync to include past bookings, not just future ones

- **Issue**: Bokun sync was only fetching bookings from TODAY forward
  - Example: October 24 bookings (2 days in past) were missing from production
  - Production showed "0 of 23" while development showed "6 of 27"
- **Root Cause**: `bokun_sync.php` line 89 using `date('Y-m-d')` as start date
  - Only synced from current date forward (future bookings only)
  - Missed any bookings from yesterday or earlier
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Changed start date from TODAY to **7 DAYS AGO**: `strtotime('-7 days')`
  - Extended end date from +14 days to **+30 DAYS FORWARD**: `strtotime('+30 days')`
  - Now syncs 37-day rolling window (past 7 days + next 30 days)
- **Immediate Result**: Synced 43 bookings from Oct 19 to Nov 25
  - All 6 missing October 24 bookings imported successfully
  - Production ticket count increased from 23 to 28
- **Impact**:
  - ‚úÖ Auto-sync now includes recent past bookings (7-day lookback)
  - ‚úÖ Handles same-day and yesterday's bookings correctly
  - ‚úÖ Prevents missing bookings due to sync timing
  - ‚úÖ Better coverage for rescheduled bookings
  - ‚úÖ No manual intervention needed going forward
- **Files Changed**:
  - MODIFIED: `public_html/api/bokun_sync.php` (Lines 87-94)
- **Priority**: üü° IMPORTANT - Affects booking data completeness
- **Deployment Status**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION (October 26, 2025)
  - Deployed to: https://withlocals.deetech.cc
  - Manual sync triggered: 43 bookings synced
  - October 24 bookings verified in production database
  - Auto-sync (every 15 minutes) now uses new date range

## üî¥ CRITICAL: TOUR DATE BUG FIX (2025-10-26)

### Priority Tickets / Tours Date Display Bug
‚úÖ COMPLETED - Fixed critical bug where tours displayed under booking creation date instead of actual tour date

- **Issue**: Tours showing under wrong dates in Priority Tickets and Tours pages
  - Example: October 2 tour displayed under September 9 (booking creation date)
  - Caused confusion in tour scheduling and guide assignments
- **Root Cause**: `BokunAPI.php` using `booking['creationDate']` as fallback when tour date fields not found
  - creationDate = when customer MADE the booking
  - Should use startDateTime/startDate = when tour HAPPENS
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Removed incorrect `creationDate` fallback in `transformBookingToTour()` function
  - Added validation to ensure tour date exists before importing
  - Added detailed error logging for debugging
  - Throws exception for bookings without valid tour dates
- **Database Fix Script**: Created `fix_tour_dates.php` to correct existing wrong dates
  - Re-parses `bokun_data` JSON field
  - Extracts correct tour date from `startDateTime` or `startDate`
  - Updates all affected tours in database
- **Impact**:
  - ‚úÖ Priority Tickets page now shows tours by actual tour date
  - ‚úÖ Tour scheduling accurate for guide assignments
  - ‚úÖ No more confusion about which tours are on which days
  - ‚úÖ Better UX for tour guides and operations team
- **Files Changed**:
  - MODIFIED: `public_html/api/BokunAPI.php` (Lines 326-339)
  - NEW: `public_html/api/fix_tour_dates.php`
  - NEW: `TOUR_DATE_BUG_FIX.md` (Complete deployment guide)
- **Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Affects tour scheduling and operations
- **Deployment Status**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION (October 26, 2025)
  - Deployed to: https://withlocals.deetech.cc
  - Fix script executed: 65 tours updated successfully
  - Zero errors during deployment
  - Database dates corrected from booking creation dates to actual tour dates

## ‚úÖ REACT ROUTER 404 FIX (2025-10-26)

### Priority Tickets Direct URL 404 Error Fix
‚úÖ COMPLETED - Fixed 404 errors when accessing routes directly or refreshing pages

- **Issue**: Direct URL access to `https://withlocals.deetech.cc/priority-tickets` returned 404 error
- **Root Cause**: Missing .htaccess file for Apache URL rewriting to support React Router SPA
- **Solution**: Created `public/.htaccess` with Apache rewrite rules
- **Fix Details**:
  - Created `public/.htaccess` with mod_rewrite rules
  - Redirects all non-file requests to `index.html` (except /api/)
  - Vite automatically copies file to `dist/` during build
  - Added security headers and caching optimization
- **Impact**:
  - ‚úÖ All routes now accessible via direct URL
  - ‚úÖ Browser refresh works on all pages
  - ‚úÖ Pages can be bookmarked and shared

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL PRODUCTION DATABASE FIXES (2025-10-25)

### Database Schema Synchronization
‚úÖ COMPLETED - Fixed critical column mismatches between local and production

- **Root Cause**: Production database was missing 2 columns and had 1 incorrect enum value
- **Missing Columns Added**:
  - `bokun_experience_id VARCHAR(255)` - Track Bokun experience IDs for API sync
  - `last_sync TIMESTAMP` - Track last synchronization time for Bokun integration
- **Enum Value Fixed**:
  - Modified `payment_status` enum from ('unpaid','partial','paid') to include 'overpaid' option
  - Now matches local database: ENUM('unpaid','partial','paid','overpaid')
- **Sessions Table Fixed**: Added missing `token VARCHAR(255)` column (fixed login errors)
- **Result**: Production database now has 40 columns matching local development exactly

### Priority Tickets Date Filter Fix
‚úÖ DEPLOYED - Changed default behavior to show all ticket bookings

- **Issue**: Page defaulted to today's date, showing no data when all tickets were from past dates
- **Fix Location**: `src/pages/PriorityTickets.jsx` line 66
- **Before**: `date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` (defaulted to today)
- **After**: `date: ''` (empty = show all dates)
- **Result**: Page now displays all 50+ museum ticket bookings on load

### Error Resolution
Fixed all production application failures

- ‚ùå **Before**: "Unknown column 'bokun_experience_id'" errors on tour creation
- ‚ùå **Before**: "Unknown column 'last_sync'" errors on Bokun sync

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL BUG FIXES & UI ENHANCEMENTS (2025-10-19)
